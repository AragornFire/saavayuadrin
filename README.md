This site original was made as an SPA using React. Unfortunately, GitHub Pages does not mesh well with either of those things, so I rewrote it all as simple HTML and JS.

Home is bland and uninteresting, no content. Armorial contains several emblazonments I've made in my shiny pixel art style. Music *will* contain links to arrangements I've made. Divine Whomst is a Guess Who-style game where you identify coats of arms
